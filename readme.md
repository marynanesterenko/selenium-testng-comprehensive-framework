This is a Data-Driven Framework:

1. We will be storing the Test Data inside the Excel files, and retrieving the Test Data using Apache POI,
   due to the ease of maintainability of the Excel format files, and the ability to store the data in the systematic way.
2. This Framework is configured to have a capability to read the data from Excel files, 
   with multiple lines of data to cover as many Test Scenarios as possible.
